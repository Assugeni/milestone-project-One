<h1> Milestone Project One </h1>


 <h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
 
Build a static (front-end only) for a band. For the purposes of this project, I have chosen to build a website for 
a band called Puddle of Mudd. 

<h2>Brief</h2>

- Primary target audiences are the fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from the back catalog, 
- and any new material as it becomes available.
- Use the site to showcase the music and publicise availability to perform at events.
- The following assets to be showcased on the website:
    - Photos
    - A video clip
    - Audio clips
    - Links to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.

 
<h2>PURPOSE OF WEBSITE</h2>
Based on the brief, the aim of the website (in both functionality and design) was produce a functional website that essentially 
showcases Puddle of Mudd music to current and new fans. 

<h4>Mockups</h4>
- Please find paper and pen mockup for the original first design.(https://ibb.co/hdCXtvD)


<h4>The initial stages</h4>

- researched Puddle of Mudd social media, fan sites, and news articles to help me build a picture of the audience I was targeting,
as well as help me create a "story" of what purpose her website would serve.
- mapped out what pages were needed.
- sketched ideas for a "four pages" website.
- draft up rough ideas of content that would appear and where.
- settled on final design.

After playing with different and potential ideas for the design, as well as taking into consideration the user experience of today's
music fans, it was decided that the following would be implemented:


<h4>Navigation</h4>





<h4>Music and Videos accessible via "External Media" Accounts</h4> 

I chose to use embedded music and videos via spotify and youtube, respectively, as these are two of the main places that i've 
found that users listen to and view music the most. Most music lovers would either use one or the other, so would be fitting to
allow them to play music from Puddle of Mudd via these platforms, which in turn would allow them to create a playlist of their own quite 
easily.

<h1>HOW IT WAS BUILT</h1>

- The main framework used to help build the website was Bootstrap V3.4.0
- Icons used were from Font Awesome. 
- Fonts were Google Fonts.

<h1>HOW IT WAS TESTED</h1>

<h4>Summary</h4>

- During and throughout the build, this was tested on google chrome using devTools, and testing responsiveness using the device toolbar. 
- Also used the elements and style sections of the devTools to troubleshoot coding that seemed to affect my page layout when I couldn't quite work out what the issue was. My mentor reminded me of this tip.
- Also tested responsiveness by resizing the window everytime I implemented a new piece of code.
- AND also tested it physically viewing it on mobile, tablet, mac and windows laptop, windows desktop, and different browsers (firefox, safari, google chrome, opera)

<h4>What was tested</h4>

- External links (to their social media, spotify, youtube and to buy concert tickets)
- Internal links (the navbar to ensure anchors were referenced to the right sections)
- Margins for the containers as fixed navbar alters the margins slightly that when you click on the link to take you to an anchor point, the navbar covers the heading. Changed margins in css to accommodate correct anchor point.
- Checked button sizes so they were responsive and large enough to be clicked
- Checked images to ensure they were responsive and displayed appropriately on smaller screens
- Checked modal-dialog size in smaller screen to ensure it displayed properly.
- Ensuring header was resized when viewing on smaller screens (aka mobile) and amending padding-bottom to account for navbar covering half the image when viewing on a smaller screen.
- Ensuring content had no grammatical errors.
- Checked margins and padding of container (sections) to ensure the content within it didn't look disproportionate on smaller screens.
- Ensured the iframes were being responsive and displayed properly.
- HTML and CSS validation via w3.org.

<h1> DEPLOYMENT</h1>

- To deploy my project I pushed my Cloud9 workspace to my Github repository named milestone-projectOne via the command line. This was done each time edits were made to my code and I needed to save them. Please find live link here https://assugeni.github.io/milestone-projectOne/index.html
